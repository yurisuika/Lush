**Lush** is a Fabric mod for Minecraft that sows the forests rich with more species of trees!

You will also find color support for the *[Seasons](https://github.com/yurisuika/Seasons)* mod to give Lush leaves ephemeral beauty. If you desire to use the *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)* resource pack, then install *[Catherine](https://github.com/yurisuika/Catherine)* and get support for not just Isabella, but also Isabella colored Seasons! Lush will then use the proper colors!

#### Compiling

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/lush.git

cd ./lush

./gradlew build
```

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
