# <p align="center">LUSH</p>

Lush is a Fabric mod that sows the forests of Minecraft rich with more species of trees! More than just a simple tree mod, Lush also adds trunk, branch, and twig blocks (and their stripped versions) for every species to give you more realistic trees. No longer does every tree just have a boring thick trunk!

You will also find color support for the *[Seasons](https://github.com/yurisuika/Seasons)* mod to give Lush leaves ephemeral beauty. If you desire to use the *[Isabella](https://github.com/yurisuika/Isabella)* resource pack, then install *[Catherine](https://github.com/yurisuika/Catherine)* and get support for not just Isabella, but also Isabella colored Seasons! Lush will then use the proper colors!

### Source Building

To build from source you will need have JDK 17 to compile and, optionally, Git to clone the repository. Otherwise, download the archive and just run `./gradlew build` from the root project folder.

#### Commands

When using Git, just choose a directory you wish to keep the project root folder in, decide which branch you wish to compile, and then run these commands:

```shell script
git clone --branch Fabric-1.18 --recursive https://github.com/yurisuika/lush.git

cd ./lush

./gradlew build

Afterwards, your compiled JAR will be in `./build/libs`.
